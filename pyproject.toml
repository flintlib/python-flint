#
# Minimum build requirements tested in CI need to be kept in sync with the
# versions in requires below so that they are tested.
#
# The upper cap on Cython is speculative but we may as well cap it given that
# it is only a build requirement and that it is not uncommon for newer Cython
# versions to break the build. For example Cython 3.0 broke the build and then
# Cython 3.1 broke the build again so python-flint 0.6.0 did not have any upper
# cap but it should have had cython>=3.0,<3.1 i.e. precisely one minor release
# of Cython works. In future we could contemplate not having an upper cap but
# until we have actually witnessed a Cython 3.x release that does not break the
# build we should keep the upper cap.

# E129 visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
# Reasoning: this rule is a little controversial
#            (see https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/386)
#            and we ignore it to avoid needing additional indentation after
#            long logical statements.
#
# E501 line too long (128 > 120 characters)
# Reasoning: this is a work in progress and will be enforced once a line length
#            and refactor has taken place. See issue #214
#
# E741 ambiguous variable name
# Reasoning: many places it makes sense to use l or other letters as variable
#            names as it is standard in mathematical notation.
#
# E743 ambiguous function definition
# Reasoning: this is a work in progress and will be enforced after #210 is
#            resolved.
