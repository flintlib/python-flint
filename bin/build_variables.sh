# Create a local directory .local to be used as --prefix when building

# shell variable and environment variables giving the versions to use for each
# dependency. This script should be sourced rather than executed e.g.:
#
#    $ source bin/build_variables.sh
#
# This is used implicitly by the other build scripts and does not need to be
# executed directly.
